## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


## Development Prerequisites
If you are familiar with native development, you will likely want to use React Native CLI. It requires Xcode or Android Studio to get started. If you already have one of these tools installed, you should be able to get up and running within a few minutes. If they are not installed, you should expect to spend about an hour installing and configuring them.

To prepare to React Native development environment following the instructions [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).

## Clone Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ghorbani-m/TriviaSampleGame.git
```
## Install Dependencies
run the below commands to install packages.
```
cd TriviaSampleGame
yarn install
```
## Preparing the Android device
You will need an Android device to run your React Native Android app. This can be either a physical Android device, or more commonly, you can use an Android Virtual Device which allows you to emulate an Android device on your computer.

Either way, you will need to prepare the device to run Android apps for development.

### Using a physical device
If you have a physical Android device, you can use it for development in place of an AVD by plugging it in to your computer using a USB cable and following the instructions [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device).

### Using a virtual device
If you use Android Studio to open ./TriviaSampleGame/android, you can see the list of available Android Virtual Devices (AVDs) by opening the "AVD Manager" from within Android Studio. Look for an icon that looks like this:

## Running The Trivia Sample Game
Run the below command inside TriviaSampleGame React Native project folder.
```
react-native run-android
```
